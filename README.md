# 🎨 Image Hover Effect | MS Prime Tech Services

This project demonstrates a creative **image hover effect** using **HTML** and **CSS**. The effect applies grayscale filtering, contrast enhancement, and a clipping animation to create a unique visual transition.

## 🚀 Features

  Images transition from grayscale to full color on hover, with a sleek top-down reveal effect.

- **Pure CSS Implementation** 🎨  
  No JavaScript is used—only **HTML** and **CSS** power the animations.

- **Responsive Design** 📱  
  The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience.
